# First run

Here is the effect we were trying to replicate.

```{r, run1-mod, echo = 1}
```

```{r, run1-plot}
```

# Second run

```{r, run2-mod, echo = 1}
```

```{r, run2-plot}
```

It seems that for some reason the trials for the second run of the experiment
were different and some questions appeared more than one time. This was true
for all subjects in the second run.

```{r, unique-propositions}
```

# Third run

```{r, run3-mod, echo = 1}
```

```{r, run3-plot}
```

# Overall

```{r, mod, echo = 1}
```

```{r, plot}
```
