This would make my responses take longer."MWPF206,LL-George,guess_answer,"The woman kept using the same choices, so I remembered those and would guess the answer to the question before she said them."MWPF207,LL-Kramer,,"No strategy, just reacted to the question and the word given."MWPF208,LL-George,avoid_mask,Read the question and then looked down at the keyboard as I was listening to the wordMWPF209,LL-Elaine,imagery,"When I saw the question, I imagined things that had that property."MWPF210,LL-Kramer,speed,i put my fingers on the two buttons pre questionMWPF211,LL-George,repeat_question,It helped when i kept repeating the questionsMWPF212,LL-Elaine,,NoneMWPF213,LL-Jerry,guess_answer,Once I heard the question I would think in advance what would fit that description.  Then once I heard the word I would act accordingly.MWPF215,LL-George,imagery,i pictured anything that the questions askedMWPF214,LL-Kramer,,no strategies have been usedMWPF216,LL-Elaine,,No.MWPF217,LL-Kramer,,not reallyMWPF218,LL-George,avoid_mask,at some point I read the question and then closed my eyes so that colorful square would not bother meMWPF219,LL-Kramer,guess_answer,"When I read each question, before hearing the word, I thought of my schema for the content of each question (ex. if the question was ""does it have antennae?"" I thought of all the things I know that have antennae). This helped me quickly identify whether the word applied to the question."MWPF220,LL-Jerry,,NAMWPF221,LL-Elaine,,No I didn't use any particular strategy... Just listened and then responded.MWPF222,LL-George,,NAMWPF223,LL-Kramer,,No.MWPF225,LL-Jerry,,noneMWPF224,LL-George,imagery,"I read the question, then listened to the word and tried to picture what the word looked like. Then I thought of the imagine in correlation to the question and chose my answer."MWPF302,LL-George,,Just thinking about what the question was.MWPF301,LL-Kramer,,NAMWPF303,LL-ELAINE,guess_answer,"Came to know they were talking about the same set of words. After a while i started guessing which word the question was about, and based on that could respond quicker."MWPF306,LL-ELAINE,,NAMWPF305,LL-George,guess_answer,after i read the question i thought of broad possible answers so then when i heard the word it made it easy for me to distinguish if it is similar to the object or notMWPF304,LL-Kramer,guess_answer,"If the question had anything to do with an object (non-living), I knew immediately to press no as soon as I heard the first sound of the name of an animal"MWPF309,LL-George,avoid_mask,"After the trait was identified, it helped me to look away from the screen to think about whether or not the sound matched"MWPF308,LL-Kramer,,no strategyMWPF310,LL-Kramer,repeat_question,I would have to read the sentence to myself to help  me remember it.MWPF313,LL-Jerry,guess_answer,i tried to identify what word they were saying by the initial letter and sound to make a quicker decisionMWPF311,LL-George,guess_answer,"Throughout the task I noticed that the same words were being repeated. When I saw the question, I started thinking of possible words that have been repeated during the task that would make it yes."MWPF312,LL-ELAINE,,no i did notMWPF314,LL-ELAINE,avoid_mask,avoided the colored boxMWPF315,LL-Kramer,,NoMWPF_316,LL-Kramer,,NoMWPF_317,LL-George,guess_answer,Anticipated possible words after reading sentanceMWPF_318,LL-ELAINE,guess_answer,Sometimes I would assume what object they would say next based on the question.MWPF_319,LL-Jerry,,nope just staying focused was the best strategy.MWPF_321,LL-ELAINE,guess_answer,I tried to think of possibilities before they said the word.MWPF_320,LL-George,guess_answer,when i saw the pictures I immediately thought of thing that would and would not fit into this category before i even saw the pictureMWPF_322,LL-Kramer,guess_answer,"If a word had been used a lot in previous trials and a question seemed like it was baiting that response (does it eat garbage for raccoon, does it hold beer for bottle) I would prepare to answer with that in mind, and that seemed to help me answer faster most of the time."MWPF_323,LL-ELAINE,speed,"I always had my fingers on the ""y"" and ""n"""MWPF_324,LL-Kramer,repeat_question,repeated the question once in my head before the woman spoke the termMWPF_325,LL-George,,NAMWPF327,LL-George,speed,fingers on both keys ready to useMWPF326,LL-Kramer,,NAMWPR102,LL-George,guess_answer,I would think of possible answers to the traits before they were saidMWPR103,LL-ELAINE,guess_answer,"I would read the question and think of things that I knew were true of the sentence, then clicked yes or no if the actual answer heard was true or not."MWPR101,LL-Kramer,guess_answer,I saw myself attempting to guess what the next word was depending on the question because the words were being repeated throughout the experiment.MWPR104,LL-Jerry,speed,I used both hands and tried to remain alert.MWPR108,LL-Jerry,speed,Read the question and then heard the word and clicked as fast as I couldMWPR107,LL-ELAINE,guess_answer,I kept a finger on both the Y and N key and recognized a patter of words and often was able to predict the words before they were saidMWPR105,LL-Kramer,guess_answer,"i would try to think of what the word was going to be before it was said, so if it was said i could quickly pick y"MWPR110,LL-George,,I do not haveMWPR109,LL-Kramer,speed,Be as fast as you can.MWPR112,LL-Jerry,speed,I stayed alert and used one hand on the key board instead of two.MWPR111,LL-ELAINE,,"I thought about the object from many perspectives; if the object could. in any situation, be described in that way, I would push Y."MWPR113,LL-Kramer,guess_answer,I thought of possible answers before I heard the word.MWPR114,LL-George,,looked at the last word of the sentenceMWPR115,LL-ELAINE,,I used common sense to determine if the noun fit with the question.MWPR116,LL-Jerry,imagery,"Watched closely, listened closely, and then pictured the object in my head."MWPR117,LL-Kramer,speed,"I kept both fingers on ""y"" and ""n"" so I could respond as quickly as possible."MWPR118,LL-George,speed,I kept one hand on the keyboard.MWPR120,LL-George,guess_answer,When I was given the question I thought immediately of what things could fall under that category and what things couldn't.MWPR121,LL-ELAINE,guess_answer,"When I read the question, I thought about things that had those characteristics before hearing the word."MWPR122,LL-Jerry,avoid_mask,Look away from screen after reading question.MWPR119,LL-Kramer,avoid_mask,"Focus on the question, think of objects related to the question, look down on the keyboard while waiting to hear the word"MWPR125,LL-ELAINE,guess_answer,Think of the possibilities of what could be the answer. ie Does it have a hump?  I immediately thought camel.MWPR123,LL-Kramer,guess_answer,read the question and thought of answers that were common and then listened for the first sound of those words so I could respond fasterMWPR124,LL-George,,not space outMWPR126,LL-Jerry,speed,"I put my hand near both the y key and the n key, so I could respond faster."MWPR128,LL-George,,"I didn't really have a strategy, I went with the flow of the test"MWPR127,LL-Kramer,repeat_question,Remind the questions when hearing the wordsMWPR129,LL-ELAINE,guess_answer,"I read the question and thought of the nouns they could say, and how I would answer."MWPR130,LL-Jerry,guess_answer,"In the brief second after the question was asked but before the word was said, I thought of possible answers and would see if they would match up when the word was said."MWPR132,LL-George,,I paid attention to the initial statement and then waited for the wordMWPR131,LL-Kramer,speed,"I had a finger rest on top of the y and n keys on the keyboard, so when I would hear what the computer said, I could click the key very fast."MWPR133,LL-ELAINE,avoid_mask,"I looked away from the colorful square at most points and visualized a possible answer to the question, making it easier to answer quicker."MWPR135,LL-George,guess_answer,I thought of an answer to the question before the object was presented to meMWPR134,LL-Kramer,guess_answer,Tried to anticipate what word it was going to say after reading the question.MWPR136,LL-ELAINE,avoid_mask,Close my eyes to think about what I was hearing.MWPR137,LL-Jerry,speed,Used a different hand for each key to try and go faster.MWPR139,LL-George,avoid_mask,Read the question and carefully listened to word after by not looking at the screen to focusMWPR138,LL-Kramer,,"read sentence, listened to word and envisioned the said word in head"MWPR141,LL-Jerry,,I listened to the question and word and thought about whether or not it made sense.MWPR140,LL-ELAINE,,I read the question and then answered.MWPR143,LL-George,,NAMWPR144,LL-ELAINE,speed,Put a finger on Y and a finger on N to maximize response time.MWPR142,LL-Kramer,,listeningMWPR145,LL-Jerry,guess_answer,"I put my two fingers on Y and N keys, and after I read the question, I brainstorm things might be the yes answer for it. After I took this for a while, like after the second break, I found there are always those words I would hear, so when I see I question like if it is a tropical fruit, I think of pineapple, and I hit the yes key even before the question mark shows up. But mostly, I judge it and try to link the work I heard and the question together. I feel hesitate sometimes when I hit the key."MWPR147,LL-George,speed,Try to press the right answer as fast as possibleMWPR146,LL-Kramer,speed,I used both hands with one finger on Y and one on N to asnwer as fast as I couldMWPR148,LL-ELAINE,guess_answer,"I became familiar with the sounds and types of objects that we being said"MWPR149,LL-Jerry,speed,I had my hands on the Y and N keys and watched the screen and listened to the wordMWPR151,LL-George,speed,"Hold one finger on the ""Y"" key and one finger on the ""N"" key."MWPR150,LL-Kramer,,I didn't have a defined strategy. I just tried to answer as quickly and accurately as possibleMWPR152,LL-ELAINE,guess_answer,I kept calm and I chuckled when I got it wrong. I also had a tendency to answer the questions in my head first with a few associations (in a matter of milliseconds) and then click based on whether what was said was indeed that word or a similar word. I also noticed a repetition of the same words and so used this to predict the next answers to the questions asked.
