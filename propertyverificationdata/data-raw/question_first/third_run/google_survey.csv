What did you see and how were you supposed to respond?,What strategy did you use to complete the experiment?,Did it help?,What do you think the experiment was about?,Did you look at the flashing colorful patterns when they were present?,Did you experience any glitches or errors in the experiment that we should know about?
1/27/2016 10:25:11,MWPR102,LL-George,We were asked a question based on traits.  An object was then said in the head phones and we had to decide whether that item had that trait or not.,I would think of possible answers to the traits before they were said,I think so,Reaction time,No,No
1/27/2016 10:25:56,MWPR103,LL-ELAINE,I read questions and listened to the answers then pressed yes or no if it was true or not.,"I would read the question and think of things that I knew were true of the sentence, then clicked yes or no if the actual answer heard was true or not.",Yes it did for some questions,Reaction time and cognitive thinking verses perception of a question and reading.,yes,no there were none
1/27/2016 10:27:22,MWPR101,LL-Kramer,"I would see a simple question, here a word, and if that word matches or doesn't match that question I would press y or n representing yes or no.",I saw myself attempting to guess what the next word was depending on the question because the words were being repeated throughout the experiment. ,Some questions it helped and others it may have made my response time slower if the word did not match that question.,I would guess it may be about the pronunciation of some words and if the response time is slower for some pronunciations. It may also be about if the colored patterns alter the response time. ,"No, I disregarded them whenever they appeared. ",At some points I would press y or n and it wouldn't register right away and I would have to hit it again. I believe that coincided with the colored patterns appearing. 
1/27/2016 10:31:29,MWPR104,LL-Jerry,"I saw simple questions, and I was supposed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible with a yes or no answer.",I used both hands and tried to remain alert.,"Yes, but I disagreed with the answers to some of the questions. Some were matters of opinion.",The experiment was about reaction time and how that correlates to how the brain filters memory.,Yes,"Not really, but you couldn't click until the question mark appeared which slowed down my reaction time because I was trying to react to a word not the appearance of the question mark. I would click too early then would have to click again resulting in a slower reaction time."

1/27/2016 13:33:30,MWPR111,LL-ELAINE,"I was shown a describe that would or would not apply to a word that was said into the headphones I was instructed to wear. If the description pertained to the word said, I was to push the Y key for yes; if it did not pertain, i was to push N for no. ","I thought about the object from many perspectives; if the object could. in any situation, be described in that way, I would push Y. ","Yes, I believe so. ",Observing how fast participants could associate written descriptions with words that they heard. ,"Yes, but they were distracting, so I ended up looking away from them in some cases. ","I may have just gotten some answers ""wrong,"" but I heard a different noise when I answered some questions that I believed to be correct if thought about from a different perspective. "
1/27/2016 14:05:30,MWPR113,LL-Kramer,We saw a question and we were supposed to respond 'yes' or 'no' whether the word we heard fit the question.,I thought of possible answers before I heard the word.,Yes,How sound and memory are correlated,"I did, but tried not to directly",Not that I know of

After I took this for a while, like after the second break, I found there are always those words I would hear, so when I see I question like if it is a tropical fruit, I think of pineapple, and I hit the yes key even before the question mark shows up. But mostly, I judge it and try to link the work I heard and the question together. I feel hesitate sometimes when I hit the key. ","Yes, it helps me to think faster.",I think it was about the speed of brain works when recognize things or match things. ,"I did, but I feels like it was too bright and I was trying to avoid it.","Yes, I am a foreigner student and English is not my first language, some words like hoover I do not really know the meaning of it, but when it shows up more often, I guessed the meaning of it, so I think I did better in the last half part of study."

1/29/2016 14:32:36,MWPR152,LL-ELAINE,I was given sentences and a word then asked to answer based on if the association between the sentence and word were realistic or not.,I kept calm and I chuckled when I got it wrong. I also had a tendency to answer the questions in my head first with a few associations (in a matter of milliseconds) and then click based on whether what was said was indeed that word or a similar word. I also noticed a repetition of the same words and so used this to predict the next answers to the questions asked.,It sure did! Seldom this method threw me off and that was when I chuckled and moved on so it wouldn't affect my performance in the next association exercises.,How individuals use associations to memorize and also to pass a judgement on the things around us.,Occasionally. They kind of distracted me and so I sometimes looked away.,Not to my knowledge.
