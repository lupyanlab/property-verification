      Welcome to the experiment! Press the SPACEBAR to begin.

      Your job today is to answer some simple yes or no questions about
      familiar objects like dogs, chairs, and elephants. Press the SPACEBAR to
      continue.

      Think of it like a game you might play with a child who is learning about
      these objects for the first time. First you'll see the question (for
      example, 'Does it have feathers?'), then you'll hear a word through the
      headphones, like 'eagle' or 'table'. After the word, you'll see a question
      mark appear on the screen. Once it appears, you'll answer yes or no using
      the keyboard. You will press the up arrow for yes and the down arrow for no.
      Press the SPACEBAR to continue.

      Some of the questions may sound a bit weird. If the question doesn't make
      sense, the answer is most likely 'no'. Answer the question
      below.


      (Remember: Press the up arrow for YES and the down arrow for NO)
    example: Does it have a seat? -> pineapple
    advance: down

      Other questions will be true for some items in a category, but not all
      items. In these cases, the answer is 'yes'. Answer the question below.
    example: Is it green? -> apple
    advance: up

      Why are we asking you to answer these simple questions? The speed at which
      people perform this task tells us something about how easy or hard it is
      for the brain to 'find' the relevant information in your memory. This
      sort of analysis only turns up meaningful results if everyone is doing
      their best to answer as quickly and accurately as possible, so please: try
      your best for this 20-25 minute task. Press the SPACEBAR to continue.

      You made it to the end of the practice trials. On a few of the practice
      trials you should have seen flashing colorful shapes like the image below.
      Please try to look at these flashing shapes when they are present. If
      you look away from the screen, your performance will likely suffer.

      Press the SPACEBAR to continue.

      Please remember that the value of this type of experiment depends on you
      answering as quickly and accurately as possible. It may seem simple and
      boring, but please try to stay focused. You will get a few breaks during the
      experiment. Try to challenge yourself to be as fast and accurate as
      possible!


      If you have any questions or concerns about your ability to complete
      this task, please talk to the experimenter now.


      Press the SPACEBAR to continue.
