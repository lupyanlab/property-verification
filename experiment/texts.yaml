      familiar objects like dogs, chairs, and elephants. Press the SPACEBAR to
      continue.

      Think of it like a game you might play with a child who is learning about
      these objects for the first time. First you'll see the question (for
      example, 'Does it have feathers?'), then you'll hear a word through the
      headphones, like 'eagle' or 'table'. After the word, you'll see a question
      mark appear on the screen. Once it appears, you'll answer  yes or no using
      the keyboard. You will press the 'y' key for yes and the 'n' key for no.
      Press the SPACEBAR to continue.

      Why are we asking you to answer these simple questions? The speed at which
      people perform this task tells us something about how easy or hard it is
      for the brain to 'find' the relevant information in your memory. Now this
      sort of analysis only turns up meaningful results if everyone is doing
      their best to answer as quickly and accurately as possible, so please: try
      your best for this 20-25 minute task. Press the SPACEBAR to continue.

    of experiment depends on you answering as quickly and accurately as
