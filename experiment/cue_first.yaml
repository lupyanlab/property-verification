        1: "Welcome to the experiment! Press the SPACEBAR to begin."
        2: "Your job today is to answer some simple, yes or no questions about familiar objects like dogs, chairs, and elephants. Press the SPACEBAR to begin."
        3: "Think of it like a game you might play with a child who is learning about these objects for the first time. You're going to hear a word through the headphones (like 'dog' or 'pineapple') and then you'll be given a question about that thing. For each question you'll answer yes or no using the keyboard. Press the 'f' key for yes and the 'j' key for no. Press the SPACEBAR to continue."
        4: "Some of the questions may sound a bit weird. If the question doesn't make sense, the answer is most likely 'no'. Answer the question below.\n\n(Remember: Press 'f' for YES and 'j' for NO)"
        5: "Other questions will be true for some items in a category, but not all items. In these cases, the answer is 'yes'. Answer the question below."
        6: "Why are we asking you to answer these simple questions? The speed at which people perform this task tells us something about how easy or hard it is for the brain to 'find' the relevant information in your memory. Now this sort of analysis only turns up meaningful results if everyone is doing their best to answer as quickly and accurately as possible, so please: try your best for this 20-25 minute task. Press the SPACEBAR to continue."
        7: "Ok! Ready for the experiment? Please open the door and tell the experimenter you are ready to continue. Press the SPACEBAR to continue."
        8: "Let's do some practice questions. Make sure you have the headphones on. Press the SPACEBAR to begin the practice trials."

        1: "You made it to the end of practice trials. Do you have any questions? If so, now is the time to ask the experimenter. When you are ready to continue, press the SPACEBAR to continue."
        2: "Please remember that the value of this type of experiment depends on you answering as quickly and accurately as possible. It may seem simple and boring, but please try to stay focused. You will get a few breaks during the experiment. Try to challenge yourself to be as fast and accurate as possible! Press the SPACEBAR to continue."
break_text: "Take a short break to rest your eyes and hands, but please stay at your computer. When you are ready to continue, press SPACEBAR.\n\n(Remember: Press 'f' for YES and 'j' for NO)"
end_text: "You've reached the end of the experiment! Before you leave, there is a short survey we'd like you to fill out. Press the SPACEBAR to see the survey. If you don't see the survey, please tell the experimenter."
timeout_text: "You didn't answer fast enough! Remember to press 'f' for YES and 'j' for NO. Please respond as quickly as possible. Press the SPACEBAR when you are ready to continue."
