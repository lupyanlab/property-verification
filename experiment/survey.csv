Timestamp,subj_id,computer,Describe what you did in this experiment in just a sentence or two. What did you see and how were you supposed to respond?,What strategy did you use to complete the experiment?,Did it help?,What do you think the experiment was about?,Did you look at the flashing colorful patterns when they were present?,Did you experience any glitches or errors in the experiment that we should know about?
1/27/2016 10:25:11,MWPR102,LL-George,We were asked a question based on traits.  An object was then said in the head phones and we had to decide whether that item had that trait or not.,I would think of possible answers to the traits before they were said,I think so,Reaction time,No,No
1/27/2016 10:25:56,MWPR103,LL-ELAINE,I read questions and listened to the answers then pressed yes or no if it was true or not.,"I would read the question and think of things that I knew were true of the sentence, then clicked yes or no if the actual answer heard was true or not.",Yes it did for some questions,Reaction time and cognitive thinking verses perception of a question and reading.,yes,no there were none
1/27/2016 10:27:22,MWPR101,LL-Kramer,"I would see a simple question, here a word, and if that word matches or doesn't match that question I would press y or n representing yes or no.",I saw myself attempting to guess what the next word was depending on the question because the words were being repeated throughout the experiment. ,Some questions it helped and others it may have made my response time slower if the word did not match that question.,I would guess it may be about the pronunciation of some words and if the response time is slower for some pronunciations. It may also be about if the colored patterns alter the response time. ,"No, I disregarded them whenever they appeared. ",At some points I would press y or n and it wouldn't register right away and I would have to hit it again. I believe that coincided with the colored patterns appearing. 
1/27/2016 10:31:29,MWPR104,LL-Jerry,"I saw simple questions, and I was supposed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible with a yes or no answer.",I used both hands and tried to remain alert.,"Yes, but I disagreed with the answers to some of the questions. Some were matters of opinion.",The experiment was about reaction time and how that correlates to how the brain filters memory.,Yes,"Not really, but you couldn't click until the question mark appeared which slowed down my reaction time because I was trying to react to a word not the appearance of the question mark. I would click too early then would have to click again resulting in a slower reaction time."
1/27/2016 12:51:33,MWPR108,LL-Jerry,Read a sentence and then heard a word and responded to the sentence if it described the work or not. ,Read the question and then heard the word and clicked as fast as I could,yes,reaction time,yes,yes. one work was glichy and repeated many times before i could press anything again and one time i could not press yes or no
1/27/2016 12:52:19,MWPR107,LL-ELAINE,I saw a sentence and then heard a word and I was to say yes if the word pertained to the sentence or no if it did not.,I kept a finger on both the Y and N key and recognized a patter of words and often was able to predict the words before they were said,yes,"Memory, multitasking, attention",Not really,no
1/27/2016 12:52:33,MWPR105,LL-Kramer,"a question would appear on the screen and shortly after a word would be said, and I would click y if the word answered the question correctly and n if it answered the question incorrectly","i would try to think of what the word was going to be before it was said, so if it was said i could quickly pick y","yes, i think it did",how quickly you can react to questions with and without distractions,yes,no
1/27/2016 13:28:51,MWPR110,LL-George,,I do not have ,So so ,So so ,Yup,Yup
1/27/2016 13:29:07,MWPR109,LL-Kramer,I saw a question and heard a word. I answered the question (yes or no) based on the word I heard.,Be as fast as you can.,"No, sometimes I went too fast and accidentally clicked the wrong answer.",What qualities people associate with certain words.,Yes,No
1/27/2016 13:33:13,MWPR112,LL-Jerry,I saw a question and hear an answer through the headphones and I needed to answer if the answer spoken to me was correct or incorrect based on the question.,I stayed alert and used one hand on the key board instead of two.,Yes,Memory and how our brain stores certain basic knowledge.,Yes,There was a long pause after one of the questions before I heard an answer through my headphones.
1/27/2016 13:33:30,MWPR111,LL-ELAINE,"I was shown a describe that would or would not apply to a word that was said into the headphones I was instructed to wear. If the description pertained to the word said, I was to push the Y key for yes; if it did not pertain, i was to push N for no. ","I thought about the object from many perspectives; if the object could. in any situation, be described in that way, I would push Y. ","Yes, I believe so. ",Observing how fast participants could associate written descriptions with words that they heard. ,"Yes, but they were distracting, so I ended up looking away from them in some cases. ","I may have just gotten some answers ""wrong,"" but I heard a different noise when I answered some questions that I believed to be correct if thought about from a different perspective. "
1/27/2016 14:05:30,MWPR113,LL-Kramer,We saw a question and we were supposed to respond 'yes' or 'no' whether the word we heard fit the question.,I thought of possible answers before I heard the word.,Yes,How sound and memory are correlated,"I did, but tried not to directly",Not that I know of
1/27/2016 14:07:30,MWPR114,LL-George,Answered questions about characteristics using written questions with verbal prompts,looked at the last word of the sentence,yes,"room temperature, it was stinking hot in here",yeah,no
1/27/2016 14:09:37,MWPR115,LL-ELAINE,I was prompted to answer yes or no to a question asking if a noun was an acceptable answer to a question.,I used common sense to determine if the noun fit with the question.,It seemed to.,I'd have to guess language learning or linguistics.,"Yes, I strongly wondered what they were all about.","One of the questions asked if the noun lived in the arctic and the correct response was penguin, but penguins only live in the antarctic."
1/27/2016 14:11:56,MWPR116,LL-Jerry,"We saw a question, heard an object, and then responded with whether or not the question applied to the object.","Watched closely, listened closely, and then pictured the object in my head.",Yes,Seeing whether I could stay focused on such easy questions or seeing if I got tricked up.,Sometimes,No
