# Determining outlier subjects

To investigate potential outlier subjects I fit the following glm to each subject: `glm(is_error ~ feat_c * mask_c)`.

There are outliers in every term when the models are fit at the by-subject 
level. The dashed vertical lines depict the symmetric cutoff criteria for
determining outlier subjects.
